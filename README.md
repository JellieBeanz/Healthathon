Interim Steps 

DONE SO FAR

UI is set up. 

If you download the code and run locally. 

you would start to go to 

http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/ ( RUNNING FROM ATOM and LIVESERVER is what i used ) 

keep proceeding ( SUBMIT / NEXT / PAYTOCONFIRM APPOINTMENT and ProcessPayment) - NO need to fill anything simply keep hitting the buttons

http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/IntroLogin.html
http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/LandingDashboard.html

http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/ApptConfirmation.html
http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/ProcessPayment.html


TO BE DONE 

from 

http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/ProcessPayment.html 

The button to be integrated is PAY WITH PAY ID http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/ProcessPayment.html

The source and destination can be hardcoded based on teh xprize.money PAY ID server

the xpring Javascript SDK 's need to be included and integrated to PAY ID APIs 

SHORTLY PUT 

you can just go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/pages/ProcessPayment.html  and proceed with next steps.
