# Care From Far USSD app

## What is a USSD application?
USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a protocol used by GSM cellphones to communicate with their service provider’s computers via text messages. We commonly use it to check mobile airtime and data balance enquiries, or to receive one-time passwords or PIN codes, among many applications.
    
## Why USSD?

* USSD works on all phones – from a R200 discounted special to the most high-tech and expensive models.
* It’s free for your clients to use, and highly cost-effective for you to implement and run.
* Highly interactive – it’s almost like talking to a person.
* Rapid exchange of data – up to seven times faster than SMS. Its interactive navigation allows for faster two-way communication.
* No Internet connection or data needed.
* USSD codes work across all your cellular networks.
* It is not mobile software or SIM based. This means it can run without either, and just needs a connection to the GSM network.
* Easily customised to suit your business needs.
